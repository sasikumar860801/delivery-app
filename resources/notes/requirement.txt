I've organized it app-wise (Customer App → Delivery Partner App → Vendor App → Admin App), based on the flowchart text you provided.

This structure matches the branching and connections visible in your provided text-based flowchart.
If you want me to zoom into one specific app (e.g. only Customer App → detailed screen-by-screen requirements), or convert any part into Laravel controller/service structure, or add missing pieces (like wallet, ratings, chat), just tell me which direction next. 😊
